*What* *is* SafeLine WAF? It is a self-hosted Web Application Firewall that helps you protect your web apps from various attacks and exploits. Some features and limitations of the free edition vs. the commercial licenses:

In my opinion, one of the most beneficial features is the option to add an additional security layer to any web application, for example through the use of OIDC. This in turn enables you to enforce MFA on an application that does not support it natively (for example Immich Google Photos alternative or the SiYuan note taking app).
