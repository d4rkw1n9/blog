 Platform introduction

1. ‍

 Introducing the Hexo platform (if Gitlab is used, Gitlab needs to be deployed by itself, Gitlabhexo needs to be imported, others are similar, the course takes Github as an example)

 Click the release tool icon:

 Note: This is the first time it has been added. Because multiple examples are currently supported, if it is the second time, a self-defined setting name can be added.

 Then close the bullet window. Click again  ** General settings **  ->  ** Posting settings ** , You can see the newly added platform in the list.

 Note: It is strongly recommended to reopen to avoid the possibility of unsynchronized configuration.

 Document rules

 The path does not support dynamic configuration for the time being, but it can be achieved by self-defined file name rules ^ v1.29.1+ ^ .

** Basic configuration **

 Document rules: [yyy]/[MM]/[filename].md

 Among them, the occupiers can be replaced dynamically as follows:

 [yyyy]   Year, for example: 2025

 [MM]   Month, for example: 02

 [mm]

 [dd]   Days, for example: 26

 [slug]   Alias, for example: test-document-xdfr45f

 [filename]   File name, for example: test document

 For example: [filename].md, [slug].md, [yyy]-[mm]d[-]slug[

 Linking characters can only be  `` / `-` _ `.` ~ ``​ Everything else will be removed.

** Classification and labeling **

 For classification and labeling, add two variables

 [category]   Get the first classification, not ignored

 [cats]   All categories are combined

 [tag]   Get the first label, not ignored

 [tags]   All labels are combined
