## About Me

Hello! I'm a cybersecurity professional with a deep passion for technology and security, which extends into my hobby of building and managing my own homelab environment.

This blog serves as a space to document my journey, share guides, tutorials, and thoughts related to self-hosting, homelabbing best practices and cybersecurity insights. My goal is to create useful resources for fellow enthusiasts navigating the exciting world of self-managed digital infrastructure and security.

Feel free to explore the posts and connect!
